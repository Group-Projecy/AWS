**Having aquired the EZ home domain from FreeNom, we must create a 
hosted zone using the domain: EzHome.gq

**we have managed the name servers with our ez home custom names. 

**Also we linked the domains with the IP address

** Then we enabled users who enter EzHome.gq into their web broswer
to be routed to our AWS server. We creates 2 simple record within AWS
adding the public IP4 of the instance. we created a EzHome.gq and www.EzHome.gq record.
