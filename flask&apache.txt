Port 22. Select advanced, SSH, and upload AWS private key. (.PPK file)

** inside the hosted zone we edited the route traffic ip. adding in the  instance ip.

**in putty, we connect using the new ip address. We then edit the servername.
vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

** then we must allow permit login for winscp

sudo vim/etc/ssh/sshd_config
permitRootLogin yes

** change the root password

** we now have to allow the root user to make ssh connects

sudo cp/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorised_key /root/.shh

then reboot machine
